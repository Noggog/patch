# Oblivion Remastered Community Patch (ORC Patch)

The ORC Patch is a community-driven effort to fix bugs and improve consistency in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. It is not a complete overhaul or feature expansion but a focused patching project. We're currently organizing out of the Oblivion Remastered community-patch discord channel.
